abstract = {Abstract Seven temperature-based equations, each representing a typical form, were evaluated and compared for determining evaporation at two climatological stations (Rawson Lake and Atikokan) in north-western Ontario, Canada. The comparison was first made using the original constant values involved in each equation, and then using the recalibrated constant values. The results show that when the original constant values were used, larger biases existed for most of the equations for both stations. When recalibrated constant values were substituted for the original constant values, six of the seven equations improved for both stations. Using locally calibrated parameter values, all seven equations worked well for determining mean seasonal evaporation values. For monthly evaporation values, the modified Blaney–Criddle method produced least error for all months for both stations, followed by the Hargreaves and Thornthwaite methods. The Linacre, Kharrufa and Hamon methods showed a significant bias in September for both stations. With properly determined constant values, the modified Blaney–Criddle, the Hargreaves and Thornthwaite methods can be recommended for estimating evaporation in the study region, as far as temperature-based methods are concerned.

abstract = {Abstract Eight radiation-based equations for determining evaporation were evaluated and expressed in five generalized forms. Five evaporation equations (Abtew, Hargreaves, Makkink, Priestley and Taylor and Turc), where each represents one generalized form, were then compared with pan evaporation measured at Changins station in Switzerland. The comparison was first made using the original constant values involved in each equation, and then using the recalibrated constant values. Evaluation of the Priestley and Taylor equation requires net radiation data as input, in this study, net radiation was estimated using Equation (16) owing to the lack of observation data. The results showed that when the original constant values were used, large errors resulted for most of the equations. When recalibrated constant values were substituted for the original constant values, four of the five equations improved greatly, and all five equations performed well for determining mean annual evaporation. For seasonal and monthly evaporation, the Hargreaves and Turc equations showed a significant bias, especially for cold months. With properly determined constant values, the Makkink and modified Priestley and Taylor equations resulted in monthly evaporation values that agreed most closely with pan evaporation in the study region. The simple Abtew equation can also be used when other meteorological data except radiation are not available. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

author = {Edward T. Linacre},
abstract = {The Penman formula for the evaporation rate from a lake is simplified to the following: E0=700Tm/(100−A)+15(T−Td)(80−T)(mmday−1) where Tm = T + 0.006h, h is the elevation (metres), T is the mean temperature, A is the latitude (degrees) and Td is the mean dew-point. Values given by this formula typically differ from measured values by about 0.3 mm day−1 for annual means, 0.5 mm day−1 for monthly means, 0.9 mm day−1 for a week and 1.7 mm day−1 for a day. The formula applies over a wide range of climates. Monthly mean values of the term (T − Td) can be obtained either from an empirical table or from the following empirical relationship, provided precipitation is at least 5 mm month−1 and (T − Td) is at least 4°C:(T−Td)=0.0023h+0.37T+0.53R+0.35Rann−10.9°C where R is the mean daily range of temperature and Rann is the difference between the mean temperatures of the hottest and coldest months. Thus the evaporation rate can be estimated simply from values for the elevation, latitude and daily maximum and minimum temperatures.}

abstract = {This research sought to identify the most relevant approach to calculate potential evapotranspiration (PE) for use in a daily rainfall–runoff model, while answering the following question: How can we use available atmospheric variables to represent the evaporative demand at the basin scale? The value of 27 PE models was assessed in terms of streamflow simulation efficiency over a large sample of 308 catchments located in France, Australia and the United States. While trying to identify which atmospheric variables were the most relevant to compute PE as input to rainfall–runoff models, we showed that the formulae based on temperature and radiation tend to provide the best streamflow simulations. Surprisingly, PE approaches based on the Penman approach seem less advantageous to feed rainfall–runoff models. This investigation has resulted in a proposal for a temperature-based PE model, combining simplicity and efficiency, and adapted to four rainfall–runoff models. This PE model only requires mean air temperature (derived from long-term averages) and leads to a slight but steady improvement in rainfall–runoff model efficiency.}

However, implementing ET models in a consistent manner is difficult due to the significant diversity in process representations, assumptions, nomenclature, terminology, units and data requirements. An R package is therefore introduced to estimate actual, potential and reference ET using 17 well-known models. Data input is flexible, and customized data checking and pre-processing methods are provided. Results are presented as summary text and plots. Comparisons of alternative ET estimates can be visualized for multiple models, and alternative input data sets. The ET estimates also can be exported for further analysis, and used as input to rainfall-runoff models.}

abstract = {Abstract Evaporation is the phenomenon by which a substance is converted from its liquid into its vapor phase, independently of where it lies in nature. However, language is alive, and just like regular speech, scientific terminology changes. Frequently, those changes are grounded on a solid rationale, but sometimes these semantic transitions have a fragile foundation. That is the case with “evapotranspiration.” A growing generation of scientists have been educated on using this terminology and are unaware of the historical controversy and physical inconsistency that surrounds it. Here, we present what may appear to some as an esoteric linguistic discussion, yet it was originally triggered by the increasing time some of us have devoted to justifying our word choice to reviewers, editors, and peers. By clarifying our arguments for using the term “evaporation,” we also seek to prevent having to revive this discussion every time a new article is submitted, so that we can move directly on to more scientifically relevant matters.},
